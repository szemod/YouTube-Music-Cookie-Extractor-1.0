YouTube Music Cookie Extractor  1.1

Extract the files into a folder. 

Navigate to chrome://extensions/ or edge://extensions/, 

enable developer mode, and click on Load unpacked extension to select the folder where you extracted the extension. 

Use the extension to copy the cookie to your clipboard with one click after logging in with your YouTube Premium account.

Two new features were added in version 1.1: A new button called "Save Cookie to File" allows you to download the YouTube Music cookie to cookie.txt in the downloads folder. The other feature automates this process; when the https://music.youtube.com/ page is opened, the extension automatically downloads the YouTube Music cookie to cookie.txt.
